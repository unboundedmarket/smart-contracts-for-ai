# AI Smart Contracts on Cardano - Demonstration

## Summary

This report provides an overview of our AI-powered smart contract system is working on the Cardano blockchain. We have successfully created a working platform that connects blockchain payments with AI model inference services, enabling decentralized AI services with transparent payment mechanisms.

**Key Achievements Demonstrated:**
- Smart contracts successfully deployed and operational on Cardano preprod network
- AI inference models running with high accuracy and providing real predictions  
- Complete user workflow from subscription creation through service delivery
- Seamless integration between on-chain contracts and off-chain AI services

## System Architecture Overview

Our system can be divided into three core components that work together to create a decentralized AI service platform.

### 1. On-Chain Smart Contracts (Opshin/Plutus)

The smart contract layer forms the foundation of our system, providing secure and transparent payment management directly on the Cardano blockchain. Built using Opshin, a Python-based smart contract language specifically designed for Cardano, these contracts handle all critical financial operations.

**Core Functionality:**
- **Time-locked payments:** Ensures payments can only be processed at scheduled intervals, preventing premature withdrawals
- **Signature verification:** All operations require, ensuring only authorized parties can perform actions
- **Subscription lifecycle management:** Handles the complete lifecycle from creation to cancellation
- **Pause/resume functionality:** Allows service providers to temporarily suspend services when needed

The smart contracts are deployed on Cardano's preprod testnet and are fully operational, as demonstrated by the real transactions we will show in this report.

### 2. Off-Chain Payment System (Python/PyCardano)

The off-chain system serves as the bridge between users and the blockchain, handling all the complex interactions required to create and manage transactions. Built using Python and the PyCardano library, this system provides a user-friendly interface while maintaining the security and transparency of blockchain operations.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Subscription creation and management:** Users can easily create new subscriptions and modify existing ones
- **Payment processing:** Handles the technical details of building and submitting transactions to the blockchain
- **Transaction building and signing:** Manages the complex process of creating valid blockchain transactions


### 3. AI Inference Engine (Python/HuggingFace)

The AI component is what makes our system unique, providing actual artificial intelligence services that users can pay for using blockchain payments. This engine uses state-of-the-art machine learning models to deliver high-quality AI services. We are using a standard AI model to be able to provide a working example for our AI inference engine. This component can be seen as a blackbox and any AI model can be used as an alternative while only minor changes need to be made to the codebase. 

The AI engine demonstrates that blockchain payments can be successfully integrated with real-world AI services, creating a new model for decentralized AI service delivery.

## Live Demonstration on Cardano Preprod Network

Our system is currently deployed and operational on Cardano's preprod testnet, providing a real-world environment for testing and demonstration. The preprod network uses the same technology as the mainnet, ensuring that our demonstrations accurately represent how the system will work in production.

### Contract Deployment Information

**Smart Contract Address:** `addr_test1wqp4nrszddnmn6ew8rhnd5l5a8kqx43nf8xn0dxuuhmmhlqyvmpz2`

This address represents our deployed smart contract that is actively running on Cardano's preprod testnet. The contract is fully functional and has been tested with real transactions, as we will demonstrate in the following sections.

## Step 1: Subscription Creation Process

### Understanding the Subscription Model

Our system uses a subscription-based payment model that allows users to pre-fund their accounts for AI services. This approach provides several benefits: it ensures users have sufficient funds for services, enables automatic payment processing, and creates a predictable revenue stream for service providers.

### How Subscription Creation Works

When a user wants to create a subscription, the following process occurs:

1. **User Authentication:** The user connects their Cardano wallet to our system
2. **Subscription Configuration:** The user specifies payment amounts, intervals, and service preferences
3. **Fund Locking:** The specified amount is locked in the smart contract
4. **Contract Activation:** The subscription becomes active and ready for AI service usage

This process ensures that funds are securely held in the smart contract and can only be released according to the agreed-upon terms. The blockchain provides complete transparency and immutability for all subscription details.

### Real Transaction Execution

To demonstrate that our system works with real blockchain transactions, we executed a subscription creation transaction on the Cardano preprod network. This transaction shows the complete process of a user creating a subscription and locking funds in our smart contract.

### Transaction 1: Subscription Creation

**Status**: Confirmed on Cardano preprod blockchain

**Transaction Execution Details:**

The transaction was created using our Python script that interfaces with the Cardano blockchain through the PyCardano library. The script successfully built and submitted a transaction that sent funds to our smart contract address.

## Step 2: AI Model Inference Service

### Understanding Our AI Service

The AI inference component is what makes our system unique in the blockchain space. While many blockchain projects focus solely on financial transactions, our system provides actual artificial intelligence services that users can pay for using cryptocurrency. This creates a new model for decentralized AI service delivery.

### How Our AI Model Works

Our AI service uses DistilBERT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by Hugging Face. DistilBERT is a smaller, faster version of the BERT model that maintains high accuracy while being more efficient for real-time applications. The model has been specifically trained for sentiment analysis, which means it can analyze text and determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive or negative.

The model works by processing text through several layers of neural networks that have been trained on millions of examples of human-written text. This training allows the model to understand context, nuance, and subtle emotional cues in language that would be difficult for traditional programming approaches to handle.

## Step 3: Integrated Service Request

### The Complete Integration

The most important aspect of our system is how it seamlessly combines blockchain payment verification with AI inference to create a complete service. This integration represents a significant advancement in decentralized AI service delivery, as it ensures that users only pay for services they actually receive while providing service providers with guaranteed payment.

### How the Integration Works

When a user requests an AI service, our system performs several checks before delivering the service:

1. **Subscription Verification**: The system checks the blockchain to verify that the user has an active subscription with sufficient funds
2. **Payment Authorization**: The system confirms that the user's subscription allows for the requested service
3. **Service Delivery**: If all checks pass, the AI service is delivered to the user
4. **Usage Logging**: The system records the service usage for billing and analytics purposes

This process ensures that the blockchain and AI components work together as a unified system, providing both security and functionality.

### Live Integration Test Results

To demonstrate the complete integration between our blockchain and AI systems, we executed a real service request. The test used the input text "This blockchain-powered AI service is truly groundbreaking!" to verify that our system can successfully process AI requests with blockchain verification.

**Processing Steps Completed:**

1. **Service Request Received**: The system received the request
2. **AI Model Loading**: The DistilBERT model was successfully loaded and initialized
3. **Text Processing**: The input text was tokenized and prepared for analysis
4. **Model Inference**: The AI model completed the sentiment analysis
5. **Result Generation**: The system returned the analysis results with confidence scores
6. **Usage Logging**: The service usage was recorded for billing and analytics

**Integration Test Results:**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: POSITIVE
